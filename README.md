Random things that might be fun, and which work nicely on a website (experimenting with javascript/svg/css/html). 

**Check out manybody_gravity.html** (a simulation of a star cluster, in 226 lines of html, including user interface)

I am particularly fond of self-contained and compact html files that do not load any libraries but still run some nice simulation, for example (using a bit of javascript). While I prefer the syntax of python (and the excellent scientific packages), I do appreciate that JavaScript is allows for high-quality, fast, and interactive graphics, and all of that cross-platform (just started learning javascript in Aug 2020).
